As a young adult she took an interest in mathematics, and in particular Babbage's work on the analytical engine.  Though Babbage's engine was never built, Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also foresaw the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others, including Babbage himself, focused only on these capabilities.",

Its leaders have often been described as either \"physical force\" or \"moral force\" leaders, depending upon their attitudes to violent protest. Chartists were largely unsuccessful at convincing Parliament to reform the voting system of the mid-1800s; however, this movement caught the interest of the working class. The working class's interest in politics from that point on aided later suffrage movements.\r\n",

In the first century AD, Hero of Alexandria described the device, and many sources give him the credit for its invention. The name \u2013 derived from the Greek words \"aeolos\" and \"pila\" \u2013 translates to \"the ball of Aeolus\"; Aeolus being the Greek god of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe aeolipile consists of a vessel, usually a \"simple\" solid of revolution, such as a sphere or a cylinder, arranged to rotate on its axis, having oppositely bent or curved nozzles projecting from it (tipjets). When the vessel is pressurized with steam, steam is expelled through the nozzles, which generates thrust due to the rocket principle<ref>Aeolipile<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> as a consequence of the 2nd and 3rd of Newton's laws of motion. When the nozzles, pointing in different directions, produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the bearings, the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment (mechanical couple), or torque, causing the vessel to spin about its axis. Aerodynamic drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed (rpm) and consume the accelerating torque, eventually canceling it and achieving a steady state speed.\r\n\r\nTypically, and as Hero described the device, the water is heated in a simple boiler which forms part of a stand for the rotating vessel. Where this is the case the boiler is connected to the rotating chamber by a pair of pipes that also serve as the pivots for the chamber. Alternatively the rotating chamber may itself serve as the boiler, and this arrangement greatly simplifies the pivot/bearing arrangements, as they then do not need to pass steam. This can be seen in the illustration of a classroom model to the right.\r\n",

This didn't put people off coal both for home use and for industry though, and gradually mining became more ambitious, moving on from surface mining as techniques were adopted to keep tunnels intact as coal seams were mined through them."

They are also not just the domain of the rich, though places like theme parks still spend millions on complex systems designed purely to entertain, and which can push the boundaries of large-scale engineering - perhaps not the classical type of automata, but still interesting nonetheless."

Underground mines, with tunnels braced using tree branches, were already common when George Bruce took the perhaps natural step forward of mining under the sea.

In particular, it sped up the process of weaving but not spinning, which helped drive innovation in the spinning process.\r\n\r\nLike many of the inventions around weaving, the introduction of the flying shuttle was controversial; it allowed a single operator to produce much larger quantities of cloth, as well as simplifying the work required. It was also occasionally quite dangerous; the shuttle occasionally decided to take the \"flying\" part of its name literally and shoot off of the loom and through the air, maiming workers."

In addition, most mills built large estates to house all the new workers, building up new communities.\r\n\r\nThe darker side was that the number of children employed (and injured) in the factories was substantial; children were often the right size to work in amongst the machines, right next to all the moving parts."

Combined with a working day based on the clock rather than daylight hours, it resulted in a continuous process that was able to supply huge amounts of thread to the new thread-hungry looms."
